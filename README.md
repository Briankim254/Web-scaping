## Introduction

Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting large amounts of data from websites for various purposes, such as creating databases, analyzing trends, or even using it for machine learning. The CIA World Factbook is a valuable resource containing information about countries around the globe. This repository demonstrates the power of web scraping by extracting relevant data from the Factbook and analyzing it using Python and the Beautiful Soup library.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Beautiful Soup 4
- Requests
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (for data visualization)

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```
pip install jupyter beautifulsoup4 requests pandas matplotlib
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/Briankim254/Web-scaping.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory using `cd Web-scaping`
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook using `jupyter notebook`
4. Open the provided Notebook file in your browser

## Usage

1. Run the cells in the Jupyter Notebook to scrape data from the CIA World Factbook
2. Analyze the data using the provided data analysis techniques
3. Modify the Notebook to implement your own data analysis strategies or to explore different aspects of the Factbook data
4. Use the extracted data and insights to inform decision-making, research, or other applications

## Contribution Guidelines

2. Make your changes or additions to the project
3. Create a pull request and wait for a review from a team member

Please ensure that your code adheres to best practices for code quality and documentation.

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

Web scraping is a powerful tool, but it is important to be aware of the legal and ethical implications of using it. Many websites have terms of service that prohibit the use of web scraping, and it is important to respect these terms. Overall, web scraping can be a valuable tool for extracting data from the web, but it should be used responsibly and with respect for the rights of website owners.

The CIA Factbook is a public domain resource, so we can scrape it without violating the terms of service. However, it is crucial to respect the terms of service of other websites and only scrape those that allow it.
